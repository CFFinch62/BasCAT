# 1. Course Overview

## What Makes This Course Unique

**Assembly-First Approach**:
- Students learn low-level programming BEFORE high-level
- Builds deep understanding of computer fundamentals
- Makes high-level languages easier to appreciate
- Students see "under the hood" first

**Dual-Language Learning**:
- Assembly (Weeks 1-6): Foundation
- BASIC (Weeks 7-8): Abstraction
- Both together (Weeks 9-15): Integration

**Visual Learning**:
- BasCAT shows CPU circuits in real-time
- Students see registers, ALU, memory
- Step-through execution
- Compilation visualization

## Course Philosophy

**Conscious Engagement** (Chuck's approach):
- Make abstract concepts concrete
- Visual, observable execution
- Hands-on from day one
- Critical thinking over memorization

**For Students Who**:
- Don't fit traditional CS molds
- Need to see how things work
- Learn better with visuals
- Think differently

## Expected Outcomes

After 15 weeks, students can:
- Write assembly and BASIC programs
- Understand computer architecture

# 3. Teaching Strategies

## Week 1 is CRITICAL

**First impressions matter**:
- Make it FUN immediately
- First program in 10 minutes
- See immediate results
- Build confidence

**Hook Students**:
- "You're learning what professionals use"
- "You're seeing inside the computer"
- "This is REAL programming"

## The Assembly Challenge

**Students may struggle**:
- Syntax is unfamiliar
- Very low-level
- Seems tedious

**Your responses**:
- "This is how computers REALLY work"
- "High-level languages hide this"
- "You're learning the foundation"
- "It gets easier - promise!"

**When to push, when to support**:
- Week 1-2: Heavy support
- Week 3-4: Gradual independence
- Week 5-6: Student-driven
- Week 7+: Payoff (BASIC seems easy!)

## Live Coding Best Practices

**Do this**:
- Make intentional mistakes (show debugging)
- Think aloud
- Ask students to predict
- Use large font
- Step through slowly

**Don't do this**:
- Type perfect code quickly
- Skip explanations
- Ignore questions
- Go too fast
- Assume understanding

## The "Step Through" Technique

**Most powerful teaching tool**:
1. Write code together
2. Run in step mode
3. Watch registers change
4. See ALU activate
5. Observe memory updates
6. Predict next step

Students who struggle with code often excel at "watching" execution.

## Pair Programming

**Highly effective**:
- Driver: Types code
- Navigator: Thinks ahead
- Switch roles frequently
- Reduces frustration
- Builds collaboration

**Pairing strategies**:
- Strong + struggling: Mentoring
- Similar level: Collaboration  
- Self-selected: Social learning
- Teacher-assigned: Strategic

# 4. Common Student Difficulties

## Week 1-2: Syntax and Concepts

**"I don't understand registers"**:
- Use physical boxes analogy
- Only 4 boxes (A, B, C, D)
- Can only hold one number each
- Must move data between them

**"What's memory?"**:
- Like numbered mailboxes
- Each address holds one value
- Must know address to access
- Different from registers

**"Why HALT?"**:
- Computer keeps executing
- Without HALT, runs into random memory
- Demo: Program without HALT (crashes)

## Week 3-4: Logic and Control Flow

**"Binary is hard"**:
- Start with small numbers (0-15)
- Use visual charts
- Don't require memorization
- Focus on concepts, not conversion speed

**"Jumps confuse me"**:
- Draw flowcharts
- Use arrows on code
- Step through execution
- Compare to IF statements they'll learn

**"My loops don't work"**:
- Check counter initialization
- Check increment/decrement
- Check comparison
- Check jump condition
- Off-by-one errors are NORMAL

## Week 5-6: Stack and Integration

**"Stack makes no sense"**:
- Physical plate demonstration
- Last in, first out
- PUSH adds, POP removes
- Must balance

**"My program is too complex"**:
- Break into smaller pieces
- Test each piece separately
- Use comments as roadmap
- Design before coding

## Week 7-8: BASIC Transition

**"This seems too easy"**:
- Exactly! That's the point!
- Appreciate what compilers do
- Understand the trade-offs
- See the abstraction value

**"Why learn BASIC when Python exists?"**:
- See compilation clearly
- Understand translation
- Learn language concepts
- Foundation for modern languages

## Week 9-15: Concepts and Integration

**"Architecture is abstract"**:
- Connect to BasCAT visuals
- Refer to assembly experience
- Use real-world examples
- Make it concrete

**"How do I choose languages?"**:
- Consider requirements
- Think about trade-offs
- No perfect answer
- Context matters
