## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made:
1. Course format: 15-week semester
2. Structure: Assembly first (Weeks 1-6), then BASIC (Weeks 7-10), then concepts (Weeks 11-15)
3. Three parallel tracks: High School, College, Advanced Middle School
4. Assessment: Mix of projects, quizzes, and exams

### Questions to Resolve:
- [ ] Prerequisites: None? Basic typing/computer skills?
- [ ] Class size: Optimal group size for BasCAT activities?
- [ ] Lab time: How much computer lab access assumed?
- [ ] Grading: Percentage breakdown (projects/quizzes/exams)?

### Resources Needed:
- [ ] Standards alignment (optional - CSTA, ISTE, state standards)
- [ ] Sample syllabus template
- [ ] Parent communication materials?
